## My process
- First I try to set the size of the contents of the site and put the children where they belong. Use the sample images guide [active.state](design/active-states.jpg), [desktop.desing](design/desktop-design.jpg), [desktop.preview](design\desktop-preview. jpg), [desktop.thanks.status](design/desktop-thank-you-state.jpg).
- After doing this, I adapted the web pages to the size of 375 px wide for mobile devices. Use the sample image guide [movile.desing](design/mobile-design.jpg),
[mobile.thanks.status](design/mobile-thank-you-state.jpg).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
  Doing this project I refreshed my knowledge of responsive web design (learned at freecodecamp.org). Also, I did this project basically to consolidate my knowledge about CSS flexbox, javaScript and HTML5.

### Continued development
  I want to learn more about javascript and web design in my future as a web developer. Also, I want to learn React or some JavaScript library to have better performance in my projects. 

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/learn/responsive-web-design) - This helped me for responsive design. I really liked these lessons and recommend them to anyone who is still learning web design.
